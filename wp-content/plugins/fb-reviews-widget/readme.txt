Combine Google reviews, Yelp reviews and Facebook Recommendations in a single widget, block or shortcode. Build a trusted website!

== Description ==

⭐ **Reviews Widget for Google, Yelp & Facebook** is a simple and powerful WordPress plugin that displays real customer reviews from three major platforms into combined feed.

---

## ⭐ Unified feed — Google + Yelp + Facebook together

📌 This plugin brings together reviews from **Google**, **Yelp**, and **Facebook Recommendations** into a single combined feed.
📌 You no longer need separate plugins for each platform — everything is managed in one place using one widget, one shortcode and one settings panel.
📌 This reduces setup time, avoids plugin conflicts and keeps your site lighter and easier to manage.

---

## ⭐ Unlimited business locations & unlimited widgets

📍 **Unlimited locations** — connect any number of Google places, Yelp listings or Facebook Pages.
🗂️ **Unlimited widgets** — each widget can use its own layout and source selection.
🔧 Each widget can display a different location, different platform or any custom combination of Google, Yelp or Facebook sources.

There are no limits on:
- number of locations
- number of widgets
- number of shortcodes
- number of pages where you display reviews

---

## ⭐ API usage & platform limitations

This plugin uses the official Facebook Graph API to show **all recommendations** and requires an owner rights to the FB page. It displays up to **10 Google reviews** and **3 Yelp reviews** at the first install and can **collect it daily to show more reviews**.

---

## ⭐ Why display social reviews?

📈 Build trust and credibility
📌 Improve conversions
📉 Reduce bounce rate
⏱️ Increase dwell time
🏆 Strengthen local business reputation
🚀 Add verified social proof near your call-to-action

This plugin gives you full control — show a few top reviews or an entire feed.

---

## ⭐ Manual filtering & moderation

You have full manual control over what is displayed.
If a review is irrelevant or not needed — hide it with one click.
This helps maintain a clean and relevant feed.

---

## ⭐ Multiple display layouts

Choose between:

- List
- Grid
- Slider (carousel)

Suitable for sidebars, landing pages, homepage sections, footers and full-width layouts.

---

## ⭐ SEO & performance benefits
